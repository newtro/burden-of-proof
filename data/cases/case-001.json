  "synopsis": "Victor Langley, a successful real estate developer, was found dead in his office at Langley & Harrison Development on a Saturday evening. He had been struck twice on the back of the head with a heavy marble bookend. His business partner of 12 years, Thomas Harrison, was arrested the following morning after witnesses reported a heated argument between the two men that same afternoon.\n\nThe prosecution's case rests on motive (Harrison was about to be forced out of the partnership), opportunity (he was the last known person to see Langley alive), and circumstantial physical evidence. But the timeline is tight, the forensics are ambiguous, and not everyone is telling the truth.\n\nThis is your first real case. The stakes are life or death.",
  "truthNarrative": "Thomas Harrison did argue with Victor Langley on Saturday afternoon about Langley's plan to dissolve their partnership and buy Harrison out at a fraction of fair market value. The argument was fierce, and Harrison left the office at approximately 4:30 PM, angry but not violent. Langley was killed between 6:00 and 8:00 PM. The actual killer was Langley's wife, Catherine Langley, who came to the office at 6:15 PM. She had discovered that Victor was having an affair with his secretary, Diana Ross, and was planning to leave her with nothing — he had secretly changed his will. In a rage, Catherine struck Victor with the bookend. She wore gloves and left through the parking garage, which has no cameras. She has been playing the grieving widow and subtly pointing the investigation toward Harrison.",
  "prosecutionTheory": "Thomas Harrison, facing financial ruin from a forced buyout, went to Langley's office on Saturday and argued violently with his partner. After leaving briefly, he returned that evening and murdered Langley with a marble bookend in a premeditated act to preserve his stake in the $40 million development company. Harrison's fingerprints are on the murder weapon, he had clear motive, and he was the last known person at the scene.",
  "defenseTheory": "Thomas Harrison argued with his partner but left the office alive and went home. His fingerprints on the bookend are explained by the fact that it was a shared office — he touched that bookend regularly. The prosecution has no direct evidence, no eyewitness to the killing, and a timeline that doesn't hold up. Someone else killed Victor Langley, and the investigation was too quick to look beyond the obvious suspect.",
