  "synopsis": "Maria Martinez, a 24-year-old nursing student, has been charged with shoplifting a $200 portable speaker from ValueMart Electronics. The store clerk claims he saw her conceal the item in her bag and walk past the registers. Security footage exists but is grainy. Martinez insists she paid for the item at a self-checkout kiosk and has a receipt — but the receipt is for a different item of similar price.\n\nThis is a straightforward case that will teach you the fundamentals of courtroom strategy. Learn to examine witnesses, present evidence, read the jury, and manage your resources.",
  "truthNarrative": "Maria Martinez did purchase an item at the self-checkout — a pair of wireless earbuds priced at $189. She also picked up the $200 speaker, intending to buy both. At the self-checkout, she scanned the earbuds but accidentally placed the speaker in her bag without scanning it, distracted by a phone call from the hospital where she interns. She genuinely believes she paid for both items. The store clerk, Derek Huang, has a history of overzealous loss-prevention reports and has been warned by management before. The security footage is ambiguous — it shows her at the self-checkout but the angle doesn't clearly show whether she scanned one or two items.",
  "prosecutionTheory": "The defendant deliberately concealed a $200 portable speaker in her shopping bag and attempted to leave the store without paying. The store clerk witnessed the concealment, and security footage confirms the defendant bypassed the register with the unpaid merchandise.",
  "defenseTheory": "Maria Martinez is an honest nursing student who made an innocent mistake at the self-checkout. She was distracted by an important phone call and genuinely believed she had scanned both items. The store clerk has a history of false accusations, and the security footage is too unclear to prove intent.",
