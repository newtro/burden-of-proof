  "synopsis": "Lyle and Erik Menendez are charged with the shotgun murders of their parents, José and Kitty Menendez, in the family's Beverly Hills mansion on August 20, 1989. The brothers initially claimed they discovered the bodies, but months later Erik confessed to his psychologist, Dr. Jerome Oziel, who recorded the sessions. The prosecution says it was a cold-blooded execution motivated by a $14 million inheritance. The defense claims the brothers acted after years of horrific sexual, physical, and emotional abuse by their father, and snapped in genuine fear for their lives.\n\nThis is one of the most polarizing trials in American history. The first trial ended in two hung juries. Can you do better?\n\nAdapted from the real Menendez Brothers trial (1993-1996). Some details modified for gameplay.",
  "truthNarrative": "Lyle and Erik Menendez did kill their parents with shotguns on August 20, 1989. The abuse claims have significant supporting evidence — family members, teachers, and a cousin all noticed troubling signs over the years. José Menendez was a domineering, controlling figure who demanded perfection. Erik later described years of sexual abuse starting at age 6. However, the immediate trigger for the killings was Lyle confronting José about the abuse, and the brothers believing José would kill them to keep the secret. The spending spree after the murders (Porsche, Rolex watches, tennis coach) undermines the sympathy of the abuse defense. The truth is complicated: real abuse occurred, but the killings were not a spontaneous act of self-defense — the brothers bought the shotguns days before.",
  "prosecutionTheory": "Lyle and Erik Menendez planned and executed the cold-blooded murder of their parents to inherit the family's $14 million estate. They purchased shotguns days in advance, waited for an opportune moment, and fired multiple rounds into their parents as they sat in the TV room eating berries and ice cream. After the murders, they went on a lavish spending spree — buying Porsches, Rolex watches, and expensive clothes. The abuse claims are a fabricated defense strategy concocted after the fact.",
  "defenseTheory": "Lyle and Erik Menendez were victims of years of brutal physical, sexual, and emotional abuse by their father José. When Lyle confronted José about the abuse of Erik, the brothers genuinely believed their parents would kill them to protect the family secret. They acted out of a lifetime of terror and a genuine fear for their lives. The spending after the murders was the confused behavior of deeply traumatized young men, not evidence of a premeditated inheritance grab.",
